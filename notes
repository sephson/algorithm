# ALGORITHMS

Big-O

# Problem solving approach

frequency counters, two pointer problems, divide and conquer

# How to improve?

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problems solving patterns

# Problem solving

1. Understand the problems
2. Explore concrete examples
3. Break it down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look back and refactor

# Understand the problem

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solutions to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be the determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

# Problem Solving Pattern: Sliding Window

This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created), very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string
